                It's great you stumbled upon this page. Nothing remarkable about
                me; graduated from a local architectural degree and worked 3
                years in the construction consulting field. You might be
                wondering what's a mid-20's, construction-field salary woman
                doing writing and coding her first about me page? <br />
                It's common-sense isn't it? You've been wandering aimlessly in
                this ocean call life, setting your sails, smooth-sailing with
                the tides, and slowly handling blows hitting at you by waves.
                <br />
                But the waves kept increasing. Your sail is about to go loose.
                And then you spot other sailers receiving the same blow, some
                kept on, some jumped ship, whether its a bigger or smaller
                one.<br />
                So after all those rambling, what am I doing writing these stuff
                and codes? Well of course... <br />
                I still have no idea.
